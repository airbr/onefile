# onefile
separation of concerns? none of your concern!

just playing around with one file and Tachyons :)

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <title> </title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons/css/tachyons.min.css">
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
everything I intend to add builds upon this.

iterations will be added now and then. Iterations are screenshots of how the sight looked on mobile, Ill figure something out as I go about tagging or marking different releases.
