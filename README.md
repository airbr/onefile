# onefile
separation of concerns? none of your concern!

An evolution of ideas and practices . Really just playing around with one file.

Courtesy of Tachyons, it doesnt start much more templateish than this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <title> </title>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons/css/tachyons.min.css">
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

everything I intend to add builds upon this.

iterations will be added now and then. Iterations are screenshots of how the sight looked on mobile

Ideas:

Build a single page website a day with tachyons components. 

Go wild on a theme, starting with Halloween?

Learn about the challenges web developers face by trying my hand at my own hacky implementation.

programming ideas:

Try generating templates with tachyons.
